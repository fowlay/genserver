DONE: Refactoring: Do not pass an object around. All state is in instance
variables of the callback class.

-------------------------------------

Refactoring: Create public inner classes named Args in the callback
modules. In that way the init function can deal with named and typed
arguments.


Refactoring: Consider pulling the Atom enum into GenServer. Maybe revise
the naming .. use "status" for ok/reply/noreply/stop?


Cleanup: Revise the trace messages.


Refactoring - major: Use just a single "transport" callback class on
each side, handling all listening and sending. Presumably a single
socket on each side is enough. This design should be way simpler.
